Config:
- Ranges like 1..3 cannot be used for constants
- Issues with the config file refer to one generated by endive for TLC so they can be nonsensical
- There is a typo in Randomization.tla in endive and RandomSubsets needs the condition Cardinality(T) = k.

Usage:
- It can take a really really long time for counterexample generation to happen. You can check this by running endive in debug mode and if the only text is the first Java commands, then you are facing this problem. This should not happen and can be mitigated by changing TypeOK to be a random subset called TypeOKRandom (Check MongoLoglessDynamicRaft.tla)
- "The error call stack is empty." when eliminating counterexamples. This happens when there are too many states in the initial or any one state has too many successors. Make sure that you have a very small amount of initial states.
- Requires NextUnchanged in TLA specification (check TwoPhase)
