# automating-inductiveness

This repository holds specifications for distributed protocols in TLA+ and Ivy. They were used to compare tools to automate finding an inductive invariant that implies safety for these protocols. I have also listed the problems that I faced while using the tools.

## Tools Used

endive: takes TLA+ Specification (protocol.tla) and configuration file (protocol.config.json)
SWISS - takes Ivy Specification

## Protocols

[https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/800221.806707](Ben-Or Byzantine Consensus Protocol)
